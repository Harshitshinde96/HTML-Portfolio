<h1>Best Animes According to Harshit</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 Animes of All-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Attack On Titan (AOT)</h3>
    <p>This is the most popular anime of the entire anime industry. 
        The concept of AOT is so unique and also it is said to be the GOT of the anime industry.</p>
    <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
    <p>According to me, Demon Slayer has the best animation from all the animes I have watched.</p>
    <h3>Naruto</h3>
    <p>Naruto feels so vast to watch because it has around 700 episodes 
        but every single episode is worth the time we put in.</p>
